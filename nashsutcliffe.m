% Nash-Sutcliffe model accuracy statistic. Nash-Sutcliffe 
% efficiency is an indicator of the models ability to predict about the 
% 1:1 line. 
%
% The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient is calculated as:
% 
% 	              ?(Qobs - Qsim)^2
% =    1 -   ----------------------------
% 	              ?(Qobs - Qmean)^2
% 
% With the Nash-Sutcliffe measure, an r-square coefficient is calculated using 
% Coefficient values equal to 1 indicate a perfect fit between observed
% and predicted data, and r-square values equal to or less than 0 indicate that 
% the model is predicting no better than using the average of the observed 
% data.  Thus Ockham's razor should be applied. 
%
% Dimensions of Observed data array does not have to equal simulated data.
% An intersection is used to pair up observed data to simulated. This
% function is setup to pair up the first column in the observed data matrix
% and the first column in the simulated data matrix. Data values are
% located in column 2 of both matrices. 
%
% One critical assumption to this measurement is the data are normal.
%
% Syntax:
%     [NSout metric_id] = nashsutcliffe(obsDATA, simDATA)
%
% where:
%     obsData = N x 2
%     simData = N x 2
%
%     obsData(:,1) = time observed
%     obsData(:,2) = Observed Data
%     simData(:,1) = time simulated
%     simData(:,2) = Simulated data
